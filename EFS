we people r working on a common project in same region but my server r in a different zone but i want to configure
EFS Storage it should be mount on every server



create three instances in different servers: amazon linux, redhat and ubuntu

connect in terminal 

aws linux:
sudo su -
rpmquerry nfs-utils
systemctl start nfs-server.service
systemctl status nfs-server.service

redhat:
sudo su -
yum install nfs-utils -y
systemctl start nfs-utils.service
systemctl status nfs-utils.service

ubuntu
sudo su -
apt update
apt install nfs-common
systemctl start nfs-utils.service
systemctl status nfs.service

goto aws
search efs
create file system
give name
vpc
default
create

select the file system
view details
network
manage
which ever zones instsnces we created
add secuirity group in thar region
secuirity group must have nfs port 2049 enabled

click on attach
select mount via dns
copy link under using the nfs client
mkdir /dirname
paste the link in all the terminals
at the end of the ink where efs is written : replace it with /dirname

in one vm
inside the dirname, make a file
go to the other vms
cd/dirname - check if that file is present
